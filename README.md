AbSplice: aberrant splicing prediction across human tissues
--------------------------------
This method predicts aberrant splicing across human tissues with AbSplice, as described in [Wagner, Çelik et al., Nature Genetics 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01373-3).

Precomputed AbSplice-DNA scores for all possible single-nucleotide variants genome-wide are available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6408331) for download.


AbSplice predictions are computed from VCF files and are based on enhanced tissue-specific splice site annotations ([SpliceMaps](https://github.com/gagneurlab/splicemap)). The scores represent the probability that a given variant causes aberrant splicing in a given tissue.

AbSplice-DNA: if only DNA is available, different DNA-based splicing predictions, as well as information from tissue-specific SpliceMaps, are combined into the integrative model AbSplice-DNA (see [example](https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/tree/master/example) use case).

AbSplice-RNA: if RNA-seq from clinically accessible tissues (e.g. blood or skin) is available, these direct splicing measurements can be used to predict aberrant splicing in another tissue from the same individual with the model AbSplice-RNA.

## Output

The [output](https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/blob/master/example/data/results/hg19/example.vcf.gz_absplice_dna.csv) of AbSplice is tabular data. It contains the following columns (`variant`, `gene_id`, `tissue` being the unique row identifier):


|     ID     | Column | Description |
|  --------  | ----- | ----------- |
|  `variant` | Variant | ID string of the variant. |
|  `gene_id` | GeneID | Ensembl GeneID of the gene which the variant belongs to. |
|  `tissue`  | Tissue | Name of the tissue that was used from SpliceMap. |
| `AbSplice_DNA` | AbSplice-DNA | The AbSplice score is a probability estimate of how likely aberrant splicing of some sort takes place in a given tissue and reports the splice site with the strongest effect. The model was trained using scores from MMSplice and SpliceAI models as well as annotation features from tissue-specific SpliceMaps. To ease downstream applications we suggest three cutoffs (high: 0.2, medium: 0.05, low: 0.01), which approximately have the same recalls as the high, medium and low cutoffs of SpliceAI. |
| `delta_score` | SpliceAI DeltaScore | Input feature to AbSplice. The main score predicted by SpliceAI, computed as a maximum of acceptor gain, acceptor loss, donor gain, and donor loss delta scores. The score represents probability of the variant being splice-altering. |
| `delta_logit_psi` | MMSplice + SpliceMap score | Input feature to AbSplice. The score is computed by using SpliceMap as an annotation for MMSplice. The score shows the effect of the variant on the inclusion level (PSI – percent spliced in) of the junction. The score is on a logit scale. If the score is positive, it shows that variant leads higher inclusion rate for the junction. If the score is negative, it shows that variant leads higher exclusion rate for the junction. |
| `delta_psi` | MMSplice + SpliceMap + Ψ_ref score | Input feature to AbSplice. The `delta_psi` (∆Ψ)   score is computed by converting `delta_logit_psi` (∆𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(Ψ)) to natural scale with the splicing scaling law and `ref_psi` (Ψ𝑟𝑒𝑓): <br>∆Ψ = σ(∆𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(Ψ) + 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(Ψ𝑟𝑒𝑓)) − Ψ𝑟𝑒𝑓</br>|
| `splice_site_is_expressed` | Splice site expressed | Input feature to AbSplice. Binary feature indicating if the splice site is expressed in the target tissue using a cutoff of 10 split reads (`median_n` from SpliceMap). |
| `junction` | Intron | Coordinates of the respective intron from SpliceMap. |
| `event_type` | Type of splicing event | The `event_type` takes values either psi3 or psi5 for alternative donor or alternative acceptor site usage (from SpliceMap). |
| `splice_site` | Splice site location | Coordinates of the splice site. |
| `ref_psi` | Ψ reference score | Reference level of site usage from SpliceMap. |
| `median_n` | Median coverage Splice site | The median number of split reads sharing the splice site (from SpliceMap). |
| `acceptor_gain` | SpliceAI Delta score (acceptor gain) | Probability computed by SpliceAI that the variant will lead to an acceptor gain at `acceptor_gain_position` . |
| `acceptor_loss` | SpliceAI Delta score (acceptor loss) | Probability computed by SpliceAI that the variant will lead to an acceptor loss at `acceptor_loss_position`. |
| `donor_gain` | SpliceAI Delta score (donor gain) | Probability computed by SpliceAI that the variant will lead to a donor gain at `donor_gain_position`. |
| `donor_loss` | SpliceAI Delta score (donor loss) | Probability computed by SpliceAI that the variant will lead to a donor loss at `donor_loss_position`. |
| `acceptor_gain_position` | SpliceAI Delta postion (acceptor gain) | Delta position represents the location of respective splicing change  relative to the variant position: positive values are downstream of the variant, negative values are upstream. |
| `acceptor_loss_position` | SpliceAI Delta position (acceptor loss) | See description of `acceptor_gain_position`. |
| `donor_gain_position` | SpliceAI Delta postion (donor gain) | See description of `acceptor_gain_position`. |
| `donor_loss_position` | SpliceAI Delta position (donor loss) | See description of `acceptor_gain_position`. |

## Example use case
The [example](https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/tree/master/example) folder contains a snakemake workflow to generate AbSplice predictions, given a vcf file and a fasta file (either for hg19 or hg38, will be downloaded automatically).
The snakemake workflow will download precomputed SpliceMaps from Zenodo and run AbSplice based on these annotations.
To generate predictions run:
```
cd example
python -m snakemake -j 1 --use-conda
```
To run this example on your own data do the following:

- Store all vcf files for analysis in [`data/resources/vcf_files/`](https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/tree/master/example/data/resources/vcf_files/).

- Specify the genome version that you are going to use (currently supported hg19 and hg38) in the field `genome` of the [config](https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/blob/master/example/config.yaml#L2) file.

- In the field `splicemap_tissues` of the [config](https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/blob/master/example/config.yaml#L35) file you can uncomment the tissues that AbSplice will use to generate predictions (by default only fibroblasts).

Optionally:

- If you want to run the example on large datasets, you can enable a fast lookup interface [spliceai_rocksdb](https://github.com/gagneurlab/spliceai_rocksdb) that uses precomputed SpliceAI scores. The first time you use it, the precomputed database will be downloaded from Nextcloud (it will take significant time – about 3-4 hours). To enable fast lookup simply change the field `use_rocksdb` in the [config](https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/blob/master/example/config.yaml#L9) file to `True`.
